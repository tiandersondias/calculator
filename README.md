# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# React Calculator

A modern calculator application built with React + Vite, demonstrating fundamental React concepts and best practices.

## üéØ Project Overview

This calculator project serves as a practical learning exercise to strengthen my React development skills. Built with Vite for an optimized development experience, it implements basic arithmetic operations while incorporating important React concepts and modern web development practices.

## üí° Key Learning Objectives

- Understanding React component lifecycle and state management
- Learning modern build tools with Vite
- Implementing responsive design principles
- Practicing clean code and project organization
- Developing debugging and problem-solving skills
